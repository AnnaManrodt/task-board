## Project Name
Task Board

## Description
In this project, I created a website that will create a task with a due date title and description. The user can move each task into each of the sections to signify how far the task is. The color of the task changes as the due date approaches. The user also has the option to delete the task, when the page reloads all the created cards are saved until deleted "":po
## Usage
This project should be used as a task manager to help the user manage a busy schedule or multiple tasks with due dates. 

## Contributing
At this time I will not be accepting contributions to this homework assignment.
